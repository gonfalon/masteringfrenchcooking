# Mastering the Art of French Cooking

My wife loves Julia Child's "Mastering the Art of French Cooking", but does not love the format, nor the fact that there is no digital edition. This repo consists of two parts;

* A server utility for converting images of pages from "Mastering the Art of French Cooking" into formatted recipes
* A static GitHub Pages website for hosting the recipes and adding new ones.
